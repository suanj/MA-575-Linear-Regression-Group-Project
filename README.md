# Understanding the Reach of Facebook Posts Through Linear Regression 

Abstract:
Facebook’s power to reach a broad audience makes it a powerful tool for advertising. However, given the complex nature of marketing, the underlying cause of the popularity level of a post can be challenging to understand and predict. One of the ways to tackle this problem mathematically is to build a linear regression model with variable selection, and evaluate the model performance using a separate test set of data. In this analysis, two linear regression models for “paid” (posts that got paid for promotion) and “unpaid” Facebook posts were built separately in R on a set of Facebook posts’ attributes. Results showed that, although paid posts receive better popularity overall, when it comes to each individual post, it highly depends on multiple factors. For both paid and unpaid posts, the number of Lifetime Consumers (number of people who view the post during its posting life), which is an indicator of the popularity and effectiveness of a post, are affected by Type and Category of the post, and Total Likes a post receives. Nevertheless, both the amount and the direction of the effects of these three input variables can be different in paid and unpaid posts. In addition, the number of consumers in paid posts appears to be more difficult to predict compared to unpaid posts.
